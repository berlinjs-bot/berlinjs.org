        <h3>JavaScript as the future of Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <h5><a href="http://twitter.com/trodrigues">Tiago Rodrigues</a></h5>
        <p>
          In recent times the web development community has been divided over the way JavaScript is used on modern web development and how Progressive Enhancement has been abandoned by so many developers. But what if JavaScript is the future of Progressive Enhancement?
        </p>
        <p>
          This talk will go through various solutions for doing modern web development while keeping JavaScript as a first class citizen and taking advantage of all the good things Progressive Enhancement has to offer.

        <h3>JavaScript Method Modification - Aspect Oriented Function Composition</h3>
        <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/petsel">Peter Seliger</a></h5>
        <p>
          Within the last years only on GitHub the amount of JavaScript libraries that
          claim to support Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) has risen significantly.
          But there is a difference between wrapping functions in a basic way and the
          complexity that has to be handled by aspect oriented approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this talk is to distinguish both. Live Coding examples might point
          to what developers are really looking for.

        <h3>Solving the callback hell through generators and promises</h3>
        <h5><a href="">Andreas Lubbe</a></h5>
        <p>
          JavaScript has the tendency to produce callback code that is constantly headed for the right edge of the screen and makes error checking &amp; handling anything but fun. The async library doesn't help much with errors, promises are slow and fibers unreliable. So what to do?
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 has introduced generators and newer libraries such as bluebird offer the flexibility of promises with the speed of async. This talk will introduce these concepts and show live demos and benchmarks.
